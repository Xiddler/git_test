Once upon a time in a land far far away, there lived an ugly duckling. His name was Ducky and he lived with his mother and father who were called Mr. and Mrs Duck. One day Ducky looked in a pond and saw his reflection. Then he knew he was not a duck but a swan. And they all lived happily ever after.
